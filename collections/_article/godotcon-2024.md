After a very successful conference last year in Munich, we onboarded more lovely volunteers and expanded our offerings: this edition will have talks, workshops, a game/project showcase, and downtime activities around the venue.

The event grounds we chose offer ample space to simply sit and chat, especially if the weather permits using the outdoor spaces. Scattered across the floors you will also have the option to buy food & drink. We will definitely also use the opportunity to sell limited edition Godot merchandise.

To facilitate business meetings, we are currently setting up our own matchmaking software; stay tuned to learn more about it. It will be available for all attendees, no matter the ticket choice. 

Have you thought about participating in the program yet? Take a look at our call for speakers and exhibitors below - this event is a collaborative effort between us and the community!

Speaking of collaboration, we are actively looking for sponsors to support GodotCon not just monetarily, but also with content or products. If you or your company would be interested in learning more about the sponsorship ideas we have prepared, simply download this fact-sheet we put together and reach out to [godotcon@godotengine.org](mailto:godotcon@godotengine.org).

Last but not least, as we collectively gear up to make this event a blast, people already have been gathering on our community Discord to share their excitement and reminisce about the past years together. 
Even if you do not plan to attend this installment, we recommend taking a look for potential business contacts and to be the first to know about any future events.

See you in autumnal, pumpkin-spice smelling, hopefully not too cold Berlin! üçÇü•ß

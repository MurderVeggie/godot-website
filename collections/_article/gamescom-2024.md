How is it already August? Many of you approached the Godot team about our potential presence at [gamescom 2024](https://www.gamescom.global/en). There won't be a Godot booth this year, but we are happy to confirm that you still will be able to meet Emi, Juan, Rémi, André, and me in Cologne!

***To schedule business meetings with the Godot Foundation, please reach out to [emilio@godotengine.org](mailto:emilio@godotengine.org) directly*** ✉️

*If you are exhibiting a Godot game and would like to appear on our socials, reach out to [nat@godotengine.org](mailto:nat@godotengine.org) to arrange a photo opportunity* 📸 *(this also applies for the preceding devcom by the way!)*

For any attending Godot Engine users who would like to have a chat with us, we planned a more than one way to make that happen:


## Thursday Offsite


You may join us at this official Godot Meet-up **regardless of whether you have conference passes** or not! It will take place in the inner city. 

We reserved the upstairs terrace of a traditional German restaurant and thanks to our sponsor [W4 Games](https://www.w4games.com/) you needn’t worry about snacks. 

📍 Location: Haxenhaus - Frankenwerft 19, 50667 Köln
⌚ Time: 19:00 - 23:00 CEST

🎟️ **Free tickets: https://lu.ma/k9v0lo9t**

Because our capacities are limited, we kindly ask you to sign up in advance. Likewise, if your plans change, please remember to cancel, so someone from the waitlist may take your place.


## Friday Onsite


As trade visitors, we tend to avoid the busy weekend. You might spot the crew playtesting some games in the indie area all Friday long, but to ensure you cannot miss us, we promise to be **at the [IndieArenaBooth](https://indiearenabooth.de/gamescom2024)** at **13:00 local time** for a casual Godot gathering. We might even have a shiny sticker for you if you ask nicely.

Help us know how many people to expect by **signing up** here: https://lu.ma/9nt5c8dc

See you at gamescom! 👋
